# **Homelessness_2016_vs_2023_app**

This app provides a comprehensive analysis of homelessness trends in the United States, focusing on the availability of shelter beds in 2016 and 2023. It presents data on Emergency Shelters (ES), Transitional Housing (TH), and Safe Havens (SH), comparing how the number of available beds has changed over time. Through interactive visualizations, including histograms, line charts, and scatter plots, users can explore the trends and regional disparities in bed availability. The app aims to inform policymakers, researchers, and non-profits about the effectiveness of resource allocation and guide future efforts in addressing homelessness.

By breaking down the data by region or CoC, my analysis also explores geographic disparities in bed availability, offering a comprehensive view of how homelessness resources have evolved over time. My project aims to hopefully help inform decision-makers such as lawmakers, government agencies, and non-profits on the effectiveness of resource allocation and help guide future efforts in addressing homelessness in the U.S.

## **About My Data and Visualizations** 

This app provides an in-depth analysis of homelessness trends in the United States by comparing the availability of shelter beds in 2016 and 2023. The Data Page presents the raw data, showing the total number of year-round beds across three main housing types: Emergency Shelters (ES), Transitional Housing (TH), and Safe Havens (SH), grouped by CoC Number (Continuum of Care).

The Visualizations Page brings this data to life with several interactive charts, including:

Histograms to visualize the distribution of beds for households with only children across the years.
Line charts to show trends in bed availability by housing type and year.
Scatter plots to compare the relationship between bed counts in different housing types.
These visualizations help reveal how homelessness resources have changed over time, highlighting trends and disparities across different regions, and providing insights into the effectiveness of shelter bed allocation.

## **Any Future Work**

At this moment I have no future work planned for my data and project. I would love to work with communities and other states/cities to figure out how to reduce homelessness within the United states.
